/**
 * @brief The dynamic-filter publication counters, each held as a @p Counter
 *
 * `dynamic_filter_stats` holds them as atomics for the lifetime of a connection.
 * `dynamic_filter_stats_snapshot` holds plain values, both for a copy of those atomics and for the
 * counts that one publication attempt adds to them (`dynamic_filter_publication_outcome`).
 * `dynamic_filter_counter_fields` lists every field once for both conversions.
 *
 * `producers_enabled` counts plan construction, not execution. Each claim increments
 * `publication_attempts` and exactly one of `publications_finished`, `publications_failed`, or
 * `publications_skipped_source_not_resident`; a source skip may reopen the claim window.
 * `publications_skipped_build_not_whole` is counted once per join rather than once per delivery.
 * `bindings_skipped_incompatible_probe` counts bindings whose recorded probe type no membership
 * adapter can read, which would decline every batch.
 *
 * Accumulation counters: `accumulations_started` counts attempts that allocated their partial
 * arrays. `accumulations_skipped_inventory` counts builds whose input could not be certified and
 * attempts ended because a task input could not be matched to exactly one certified batch.
 * `accumulations_skipped_admission` counts allocation or admission refusals before any filter is
 * published, including initialization leases, publication scratch, missing peer DMA, and a
 * contribution or publication GPU without an admitted partial. `accumulations_skipped_error` counts
 * unexpected or fatal failures before they propagate, and `accumulations_skipped_transient` counts
 * retryable kernel-launch errors. `accumulations_incomplete` counts inputs that closed before every
 * batch contributed, `accumulations_abandoned` publications owed by a task that never ran them
 * before input closed in an uncancelled session, and `accumulation_publications_finished` fan-outs
 * that pushed at least one filter. `accumulation_storage_leaks` counts partial storage deliberately
 * leaked because GPU work might still use it after a failed host join.
 * `accumulation_publication_latency_ns` sums the time from final contribution to first push for
 * every attempt that published a filter.
